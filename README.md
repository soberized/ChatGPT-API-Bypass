### Standard Installation

```bash
cd chatgpt-automator
pip install .
```

### Global Installation via Git

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/soberized/chatgpt-api-bypass.git
```


## Usage/Examples

```py
print("--- Running Basic Prompt Example ---")
prompt_basic = "Tell me a short, inspiring quote." 
response_basic = launch_chatgpt(prompt_basic)

if response_basic:
    print("\nChatGPT's Response (Basic):")
    print(response_basic)
 else:
    print("\nFailed to get a response for the basic prompt.")
```

```py
print("--- Running Basic Prompt Example ---")
prompt_basic = "What is the capital of Australia and when was it founded? Please search the web for this." 
response_basic = launch_chatgpt(prompt_search, search=True)

if response_basic:
    print("\nChatGPT's Response (Basic):")
    print(response_basic)
 else:
    print("\nFailed to get a response for the basic prompt.")
```


### Troubleshooting
Browser not opening or connecting: Make sure Chrome is installed and updated.

"Stop streaming" not disappearing: This could mean ChatGPT is taking too long or is stuck. The script times out after 180 seconds.

Detection issues: ChatGPT may still detect automation under some circumstances
